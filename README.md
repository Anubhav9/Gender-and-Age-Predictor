# Gender-and-Age-Predictor
Working in real time, this project can detect your gender and can also predict your approximate age.

This is a fun to do project. It predicts your gender and approximate age in Real-Time using the concepts of Deep Learning. The Repositories have been taken from Kaggle and
the modelling is done on Kaggle Notebook and Gooogle Colab.

Kaggle Dataset for Age Prediction: https://www.kaggle.com/jangedoo/utkface-new

Kaggle Dataset for Gender Prediction: https://www.kaggle.com/playlist/men-women-classification

Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) has been used for Age Prediction whereas the concept of Transfer Learning has been used for Gender Prediction.

It classifies your gender into one of the 2 categories- Male and Female and your age in one of the 5 following categories:

Child (0-14 years)

Youth (15-25 years)

Adult (20-40 years)

Old (40-60 years)

Senior (60 + years)

Model Weights have already been saved. So you dont need to train your model again. To run this file, just use the command: python3 gender_d.py. You must have Open-CV
installed on your system.
